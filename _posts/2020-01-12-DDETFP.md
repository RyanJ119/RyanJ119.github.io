I am honored to be chosen as the Top Doctoral Fellow by the Dwight D. Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship Program. This was my fourth consecutive year being awarded the fellowship from FHWA and a very nice surprise to take home the Top Doctoral Fellow award on my final year of eligibility.

Almost as nice as the award was the opportunity to deliver the first presentation at the doctoral research showcase at the Tranpsortation Research Board Annual Meeting. I spoke about our variety of micromobility work at Vanderbilt.
