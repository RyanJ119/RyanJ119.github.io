Vanderbilt University began a dockless bike share pilot program with ofo in March, 2018. The pilot garnered unprecedented interest amongst students, staff, and faculty in its first month, with over 60,000 rides. Campus administration sought to gain insight from bike data to study how people move throughout campus and to inform decisions on infrastructure.

My preliminary analytics on the first month's trips revealed that the majority of trips were short rides across campus, but a significant number traveled off campus to specific surrounding neighborhoods and downtown Nashville. Also highlighted were several high-volume biking corridors through campus that provoke furture study to ensure mobility and safety.

Comprehensive results were presented to campus administration and leadership, and analytics on new data is ongoing.
