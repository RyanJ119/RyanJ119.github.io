Vanderbilt University's dockless bike share pilot with operator ofo was honored with a Tennessee Sustainable Transportation Award at the Tennessee Sustainable Transportation Conference in Knoxville, TN, on September 18. The pilot was the first dockless mobility program in Nashville and was very popular with students, faculty, and staff. I performed the analytics on the program data, which will be used to inform campus planning and infrastructure into the future. Research on data sources from active mobility systems is ongoing, particularly with emerging e-scooters. More infromation can be found in the [Vanderbilt news article](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2018/09/18/universitys-bike-share-pilot-wins-tn-sustainable-transportation-award/).
