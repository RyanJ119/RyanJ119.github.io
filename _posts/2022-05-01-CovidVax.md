<p>The COVID-19 outbreak gave rise to an unprecedented production of models
and studies aimed at understanding the pandemic, predicting its evolution
and designing measures to reduce its spread. There was an especially strong focus on how to accurately model vaccination of a certain population in a compartmental SIR model. We build a SIR model with vaccination compartments and exposed compartment transforming it into an SVEIR model. We then split the population into major age groups to better capture the varying effect of the virus on specific populations. Lastly, we optimize vaccine schedule to minimize deaths amongst the population. All of this is done in Python using an optimation package.
