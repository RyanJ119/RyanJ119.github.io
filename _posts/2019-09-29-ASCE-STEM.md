At a middle school STEM day hosted by Vanderbilt student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, I had the opportunity to conduct a hands-on activity focused on bike infrastructure planning with over 100 students from Metro Nashville Public Schools. Students pretended to be urban planners with the challenging task of multimodal infrastructure planning with limited resources.

The event was covered by the Vanderbilt School of Engineering in a [recent article](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2019/civil-engineers-at-vanderbilt-host-nashville-stem-program-guide-interactive-experiences-on-campus/).
