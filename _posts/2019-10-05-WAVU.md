In a follow-on from my summer class at Vanderbilt Summer Academy, I joined the Programs for Talented Youth (PTY) for a one-day version of my course *Sensors and Big Data Analysis* in the [Weekend at Vanderbilt University (WAVU)](https://pty.vanderbilt.edu/pty/students/wavu/) program. The course covered electrical engineering of sensor prototypes, data collection and analysis, and microcontroller programming.
