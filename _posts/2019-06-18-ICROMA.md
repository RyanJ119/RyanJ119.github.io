I had the opportunity to travel to Norrkoping, Sweden, to present a new paper titled 'Data reconciliation of freight rail dispatch data' to an audience of rail operations experts at the 8th International Conference on Railway Operations Modelling and Analysis (RailNorrkoping). The work details the process for constructing an automated data reconciliation pipeline from any optimization-based dispatching model. This allows for the identification and correction of infeasible dispatching data at the network scale, which is a difficult and costly task even at small scales.
