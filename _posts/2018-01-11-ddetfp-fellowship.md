In January of 2018, I was honored to be awarded the **Dwight David Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship** from the Federal Highway Administration. My friend and colleague, [Raphael Stern](https://raphaelstern.com), was also awarded the Fellowship. The awards were presented at the Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2018.
