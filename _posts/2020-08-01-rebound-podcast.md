I had a great discussion with Jayson Luber from Denver's ABC 7 news on his podcast 'Driving You Crazy!'. We talked about what traffic in a post-Covid world will look like, based on our research in ['The Rebound'](https://lab-work.github.io/therebound/).

Listen to the episode on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/e173-what-does-traffic-in-a-post-covid-world-look-like/id1171896062?i=1000485738631), [iHeartRadio](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-the-driving-you-crazy-podc-31155680/episode/e173-what-does-traffic-in-68833877/), or [PodBean](https://www.podbean.com/eu/pb-jc4nj-e41cd0).
