In March of 2018, I was selected by the Eno Center for Transportation for participation in the **Future Leaders Development Conference**. The conference focuses on the development process of national transportation policy and will take place in May 2018. It is a great opportunity to continue my education on transportation policy. I am incredibly excited to learn from the experts and leaders speaking at the conference, as well as the other selected students.
