<p>The topic that I chose to explore for my Master's Thesis is a study of the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on a two dimensional domain and the properties that arise as a direct consequence to them. The eigenvalues of a given domain produce so many surprising insights that simply the study of a triangular domain kept me busy throughout my project! What I love about this topic is that throughout my study, a resource from 1966 could take me to a resource from the 1700â€™s which could lead me all the way back to 2013. It is a topic rich with exploration, both new and old which really gave me a good picture of what modern research in pure mathematics can look like.
