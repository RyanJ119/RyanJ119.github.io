In January 2018, the resarch group was invited by the National Science Foundation to present [a demonstration of our research at the Washington D.C. Auto Show](https://cps-vo.org/node/44151). The demo consisted of a virtual reality headset reliving the ''ring road experiments'' that showed how an autonomous vehicle operating in mixed human/autonomous traffic can dampen traffic waves and lead to smoother and lower-emissions traffic.

The hardware required to run high-end virtual reality is quite powerful, which posed an issue when transporting everything needed for the demo. My personal desktop computer, equipped with a NVidia GTX 1070, had to be taken on the plane. When running the VR demo for 10 hours, I had to consider thermals of the computer and whether a more compact hardware setup, such as a laptop, could have lasted all day. Additionally, the conference center has notably slow wireless internet, so we had to figure out a way to run the VR video locally[^1] and ended up using [DeoVR](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1004289456346194/). The player was fairly good (most notably lacking a repeat function) but video codec support required some experimentation to achieve stable playback.
