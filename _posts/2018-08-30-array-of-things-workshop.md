The [Array of Things](https://arrayofthings.github.io/) is a reserach instrument utilizing distributed sensors across an urban-scale area for multidisciplinary research. I, along with Derek and Prof. Work from the lab, attended the Array of Things User Workshop to assess the current state of the instrument, learn about its applications and functionality, and report the findings to NSF.
